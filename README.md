# 🧠 Coding Challenge Encyclopedia

Welcome to my personal archive of coding challenge solutions!  
This repository centralizes solutions across multiple platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and **job application assessments**, organized **by problem name**, with implementations in **multiple programming languages**.

---

## 📁 Structure

Each folder in the repo corresponds to **one problem**, and contains:
- `README.md`: Problem description, source link, and notes  
- `solution.<lang>`: One or more solutions in different programming languages  
- Optional explanations or test files

Example:

```
TwoSum/
├── README.md
├── solution.java
├── solution.py
└── solution.cpp
```
